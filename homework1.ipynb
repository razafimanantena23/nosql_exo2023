In this study, a full length cDNA encoding a UDPG gene of roseroot was identified, cloned and characterized. Its ORF (1425bp) was transferred into E. coli, where the expression of the recombinant enzyme was confirmed. To monitor the enzyme activity, 3 precursors (tyramine, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate & tyrosol) of salidroside biosynthesis pathway were added to roseroot callus cultures and samples were harvested after 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 & 96h. Along with the controls (without precursor feeding), each sample was subjected to HPLC and qRT-PCR for phytochemical and relative UDP-glycosyltransferase gene expression analysis, respectively. The HPLC analysis showed that the salidroside content significantly increased; reaching 0.5% of the callus dry weight (26-fold higher than the control) after 96h when 2mM tyrosol was given to the media. The expression of the UDP-glycosyltransferase increased significantly being the highest at 12h after the feeding. The effect of tyramine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate was not as pronounced as of tyrosol. Here, we introduce a R. rosea specific UDPG gene and its expression pattern after biotransformation of intermediate precursors in in vitro roseroot callus cultures.\", ', 'meshwords': 'Biotransformation \\nCulture Techniques \\nGene Expression Regulation\\nGlycosyltransferases\\nPhenylethyl Alcohol\\nPhylogeny \\nRhodiola\\nUridine Diphosphate', 'meshsubwords': 'genetics \\nmetabolism \\nanalogs & derivatives \\nmetabolism \\nenzymology \\ngenetics \\ngrowth & development \\nmetabolism ', 'authors': 'name ml Mirmazloum I, affil str Department of Plant Physiology and Plant Biochemistry, Szent Istvan University, Budapest, Hungary; Food Science Innovation Centre, Kaposvar University, Kaposvar, Hungary.

The whole mol-ecule of (I) is generated by twofold rotation symmetry, with the twofold rotation axis bis-ecting the C atom of the -O-CH2-O- bridge. This results in a folded or U-shaped conformation of the mol-ecule. The whole mol-ecule of (II) is generated by inversion symmetry, with the central CH2-CH2 bond of the -O-(CH2)4-O- bridge being located about a center of inversion. This results in a step-like conformation of the mol-ecule. The central C(=O)N-N=C regions of the isonicotinohydrazide moieties in both compounds are planar and the configuration about the imine C=N bonds is E. In compound (I), the benzene and pyridine rings are inclined to each other by 37.60 (6) degrees . The two symmetry-related pyridine rings are inclined to each other by 74.24 (6) degrees , and the two symmetry-related benzene rings by 7.69 (6) degrees . In compound (II), the benzene and pyridine rings are inclined to each other by 25.56 (11) degrees . The symmetry-related pyridine rings are parallel, as are the two symmetry-related benzene rings. In the crystal of (I), a pair of water mol-ecules link the organic mol-ecules via Owater-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO and Owater-Hcdots, three dots, centeredN hydrogen bonds, forming chains along [001], and enclosing an R 4 (2)(8) and two R 1 (2)(5) ring motifs. The chains are linked by N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredNpyridine hydrogen bonds, forming a supra-molecular framework. There are also a number of C-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO hydrogen bonds, and C-Hcdots, three dots, centeredpi and offset pi-pi inter-actions [inter-planar distance = 3.294 (1) A] present reinforcing the framework. In the crystal of (II), mol-ecules are linked by N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredNpyridine hydrogen bonds, forming a supra-molecular framework. Here too there are also a number of C-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO hydrogen bonds present, and a C-Hcdots, three dots, centeredpi inter-action, reinforcing the framework.
